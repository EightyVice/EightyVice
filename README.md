### Hey, I'm Zeyad Ahmed. aka 8yVice 👋
*pronounced EightyVice*

tl;dr: I code, I mod, and I break stuff.

Well, I'm an another C# developer *really fan of it* so I'm a desktop dev guy. I like C/C++ and it's deep internals.
I ❤️ game hacking, modding specially my fav game GTA: Vice City, so you can see here many repos focus on modding and taking the game to the edge!
I'm thirst to know how things actually work, I'm into Retro Computing, understanding emulators dev, reverse engineering, software engineering, compilers theory, and sometimes malware analysis.
