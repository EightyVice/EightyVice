### About Me

🚀 **Languages Lover**: I'm all about coding, especially with C#, .NET, and good ol' C. But I dabble in a bunch of others too, like C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, you name it.

👨‍💻 **Software Geek**: I get excited about stuff like OOP&D, SOLID Principles, and making sure my code isn't just functional but actually makes sense.

🧠 **CS Fanatic**: I'm into the nitty-gritty of Computer Science, from the theoretical side to actual research. Yep, I even published a couple of conference papers.

💻 **Compiler Nerd**: Building compilers is like my secret hobby. Designing languages feels a bit like creating new worlds, and who doesn't love that?

🌐 **Networking Enthusiast**: Sending stuff across the internet is kinda my thing. Whether it's making network-based apps or playing with sockets, I'm all in.

🔍 **Low-Level Lover**: Ever wonder what's under the hood? So do I. I love getting my hands dirty with reverse engineering and low-level stuff.

🎮 **Weekend Gamer**: On weekends, I'm not just coding; I'm hacking games and modding them. It's my guilty pleasure.

🛠️ **Embedded Systems Buff**: I'm fascinated by the mix of hardware and software in embedded systems. Always down for a challenge in this area.
